By seeing this challenge, we understood that we have to get two flags to complete this. They hosted a simple website at [http://fup.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo/](http://fup.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo/){:target="_blank"} (might not be available now)

I quickly had a look at the home page of a given challenge.

There is nothing to do with the downloadable files. The only thing we can do is play around with the download link

`http://fup.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo/download.php?f=951470281beb8a490a941ac73bd10953`

oh! wait.. seems like it is an [LFI](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Local_File_Inclusion){:target="_blank"} and we can change query string parameter `f` of the download link. So I quickly tried to download the script `download.php` by changing query string parameter value to `f=download.php`. No luck, I got an empty file. This time I changed `f` value to `f=../download.php`. Bingo! It worked like a charm! Here is the source code of `download.php`


{% highlight php%}
<?php
// TWCTF{then_can_y0u_read_file_list?}
$filename = $_GET['f'];
if(stripos($filename, 'file_list') != false) die();
header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream");
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='$filename'");
readfile("uploads/$filename");
{% endhighlight %}

We got our first flag **TWCTF{then_can_y0u_read_file_list?}**

Now we have to find second flag and it seems like the first flag reveals a hint as it reads "then can you read file list?". So I quickly tried different values for query string parameter `f` to download the `file_list.php` but every time I ended up with an empty page.

After some time, I thought that source code of home page i.e. `index.php` can reveal some more information. So I went ahead and downloaded the source code of `index.php`.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
/**
 *
 */
include('file_list.php');
...
...
...
{% endhighlight %}

From above piece of code, we can conclude that both `index.php` and `file_list.php` are in same directory.

After some more failed trails, I realise that the `if` condition in `download.php` script is not letting us to download `file_list.php`.

So we have to bypass this condition `if(stripos($filename, 'file_list') != false) die();`. I just skim through the documentation of [`stripos`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.stripos.php){:target="_blank"} function and found that the type checking of return value can be vulnerable. Now it's very clear that the vulnerability lies in the condition checking because they are using `!=` operator in `if(stripos($filename, 'file_list') != false) die();`.

So I quickly opened a console and did few trials in php interpreter.

As php [documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/function.stripos.php){:target="_blank"} says, stripos â€” Find the position of the **first occurrence** of a case-insensitive substring in a string

So we can trick the `if` condition by changing the query string parameter to `f=file_list/../../file_list.php`. Yay! We got the source code of `file_list.php`

{% highlight php %}
<?php
$files = [
  [FALSE, 1, 'test.cpp', 192, '6a92b449761226434f5fce6c8e87295a'],
  [FALSE, 2, 'test.c', 325, '27259bca9edf408829bb749969449550'],
  [TRUE, 3, 'flag_ef02dee64eb575d84ba626a78ad4e0243aeefd19145bc6502efe7018c4085213', 1337, 'flag_ef02dee64eb575d84ba626a78ad4e0243aeefd19145bc6502efe7018c4085213'],
  [FALSE, 4, 'test.py', 94, '951470281beb8a490a941ac73bd10953'],
];
?>
{% endhighlight %}

Awesome! Now we have the secret file name **flag_ef02dee64eb575d84ba626a78ad4e0243aeefd19145bc6502efe7018c4085213** which contains our second flag. Now we can download the secret file simply by changing `f` value to `f=flag_ef02dee64eb575d84ba626a78ad4e0243aeefd19145bc6502efe7018c4085213`.

Bingo! We got our second flag too and the flag is **TWCTF{php_is_very_secure}**

## How our payload did the trick?

`stripos('file_list/../../file_list.php', 'file_list')` returns `0` as it finds the `file_list` string at the starting position of our payload. In php, `0` means `false` and any non-zero number means `true`. So `0 != false` is not true so it won't enter into  `if` condition.

Now let's look at the remaining part of the payload. We are going two levels up to read `file_list.php`. Its because if you look at `readfile("uploads/$filename");` line in `download.php`, they are adding `uploads` as prefix. So the resultant `readfile` argument will become `uploads/file_list/../../file_list.php`. Finally we able to bypass the `if` condition and read the `file_list.php`.

## Summary
First we identified [LFI](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Local_File_Inclusion){:target="_blank"} and we exploited it to get the first flag. Next we tricked the vulnerable type checking to get the second flag.
