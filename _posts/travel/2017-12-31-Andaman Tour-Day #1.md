title: Andaman trip - Day 1
---

After arriving to Portblair by flight, Naveen picked me up and dropped at De Meadows resort. I freshed up in 15min and went to see Andaman Cellular Jail.

### Andaman Cellular Jail

It's a good place to visit and from the terrace we can see ROSS island and North Blair island ( the one which printed on back side of Indian currency â‚¹20). Later I watched Sound and Light show.

On 31st night, there was a DJ party in my hotel resort. When the party begins, there were just around 10 people. I sat in the garden and recollecting all the memories of 2017. Slowly many people joined the party but I was sitting alone and thinking about my resolutions of 2018. I thought of few action items to realise my resolutions. After that I joined the party. Everyone was dancing and enjoying with their family. Initially I got some resistance to dance as everyone is unknown to me so I was just watching the people and accompanying the DJ and suggesting him the songs.

Later, I also started dancing and enjoying myself. One girl was observing all this and I didn't care about it. She was also just watching the people dance and later she joined her family. The countdown was started and yeeeeee... It's new year! Everyone was hugging and wishing their loved ones. I was wishing aloud "Happieeee new year amma..." and that moment I felt so refreshed.
